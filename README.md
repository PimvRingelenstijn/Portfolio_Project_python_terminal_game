# 🃏 Python Terminal Game Blackjack
A fully interactive Blackjack game played in the terminal — built in Python as part of the Codecademy Computer Science Career Path portfolio project.

## 🎮 About the Game
This is not just a basic exercise — it’s a real blackjack game you can play with friends from the terminal! 
The game follows classic casino-style blackjack rules, complete with a main menu, visual card displays, persistent highscores, and local multi-player.

## ▶️ Getting Started
To play the game:

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed

2. Clone this repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/PimvRingelenstijn/Portfolio_Project_python_terminal_game.git

3. Navigate to the project folder and run
   
   python main.py

## 🚀 Features
🔘 Main Menu for starting game, view highscores, view rules, quit game

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Multi-player support — play with up to 6 players on the same PC

💬 Welcome back messages for returning players

 🂠 Visual card display in the terminal that updates during gameplay

🃏 Supports all blackjack player actions (Hit, Stand, Double Down, and Split Pair)

✅ Game creates and uses a random 312-card deck, so counting cards is possible

## 🎓 Why I Built This
This game was developed as part of the portfolio project for Codecademy’s Computer Science career path, but my goal lay beyond the minimum requirements for the project.
I created this game to demonstrate my current skills and understanding of Python 3, while also applying the new technologies I learned during the Codecademy Computer Science Career Path.

Here’s what I wanted to showcase:

🧱 Object-Oriented Programming – My understanding of OOP and structure the game with classes for reusability and clarity

📁 Reading/Writing Files – Saving highscores and persistent player data locally

🧮 Python 3 Data Structures – Using dictionaries, lists, loops, and conditionals effectively

🔧 Version Control – Building the project with Git and hosting it on GitHub

🧠 Problem Solving – Challenging myself to build a “complex” and bug-free terminal game from scratch

It's not perfect, but it's functional, fun, and the best representation of what I can do right now.
